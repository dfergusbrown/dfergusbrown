# Hi, I'm Fergus

Let's get acquainted.

I'm a budding software engineer looking to work on some amazing teams and collaborate on some innovative projects.

## ðŸ¤¿ Deep Dive

My path to the here and now has been heavily influenced by my experiences in language learning, military teamwork, and my degree in Public Health. I had the privelege of learning Portuguese and Arabic which were some of my most rewarding "code cracking" projects to date.  I loved the pattern recognition, the application of knowledge, and the creativity that ultimately went into practicing both of them. 
 It has been such a joy to find similar experiences with coding languages as well.

While I continue to expand my knowledge and practice of React, Express, Django, among others, I will be on the lookout to find larger projects or teams in which I can play a role.
